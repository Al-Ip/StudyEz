# StudyEz - FYP 

This project pertains to the final year project completed in Limerick Intitute of Technology. The setps below will idicate what steps are required in order to be able to run and build the applicaiton on your own machine.

### Step 1 - Download Android Studio
This project is develoepd using Android Studio as the IDE and requires it in order to be able to build and run the app. The IDE can be found online or by clicking this link to download https://developer.android.com/studio. Once it is downloaded and installed the moment you open the IDE you may be prompted to perform updates, accept all the updates. 

### Step 2 - Import the Project
Simply import the files like you would any other project.

### Step 2 - Adding A Virtual Device (AVD)
Since this is an android applicaiton that requires an android compatible smartphone, the use of an AVD needs to be downloaded and installed. You may use a physical device in some cases, but more issues can arise by trying to setup a phusical device than by just using an AVD. 
The AVD manager can be found here

Once in the AVD manager, click 'Create Virtual Device'. This will take you through the process of creating a new virtual device, it does not matter what configuration you select but once you get into the system image make sure it is **NOT** under **Oreo** (API Level 26). I suggest dowloading and using **Pie** (API Level 28) as the system image.

Once the Iamge has been downloaded click next and you'll be brought into the last page. Put in the AVD name and click finish.
